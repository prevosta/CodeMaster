## Workflow

PM receives Issue (Bug, Feature) from client
PM ask DevOps to create a new branch and clone the repository
DevOps creates a new branch and clones the repository
DevOps informs PM that the branch is ready
PM asks Requirement Analyst to analyze the issue and create a technical specification
